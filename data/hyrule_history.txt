Hyrule's history is long and storied, beginning with the Golden Goddesses creating the larger world that it resides in and spanning three separate timelines. Eternal and constant throughout the history of Hyrule is the presence of a hero sometimes chosen by the Goddesses themselves to fight the various people and creatures that threaten to destroy or dominate the land.
Several of the wars in Hyrule's history were fought over possession of the Triforce or dominion over the Sacred Realm, others were fought over ownership of the kingdom and its sacred artifacts, or simply desire to destroy it in spite and hatred. Places such as the Shadow Temple and the Arbiter's Grounds in Gerudo Desert serve as evidence and reminders of the kingdom's bloody history of greed and hatred.

- Ancient Battle: After the three Golden Goddesses finished creating the realm which would come to be known as Hyrule, they trusted the Triforce in the hands of the Goddess Hylia and her chosen hero. The Demon King Demise, wanting to make the world his own, gathered an army of monsters and together launched an attack against the people of the surface, murdering them and causing misfortunes in an attempt to get their hands on the power guarded by Hylia. The goddess gathered the surviving humans on a piece of land and sent it to the heavens, beyond the clouds and out of reach from the evil plaguing the land. In order to keep it from falling into the hands of Demise, Hylia also sent the Triforce to The Sky and hid the portals to three pieces of the Triforce within Sky Keep, and enshrined the Goddess Sword inside the Statue of the Goddess, to be found by her next chosen hero when the time was right. This war took place thousands of years before the events of Skyward Sword.

- Battle for the Sacred Realm: Before the Kingdom of Hyrule was established, there was an era of chaos with wars being fought over ownership of the Triforce, which was located in the Sacred Realm. The conflict lasted long enough to be considered an era of its own, but was put to an end when the ancient sage Rauru constructed the Temple of Time over the remains over the Sealed Temple. This new temple contained the only sealed entrance to the Sacred Realm. The Triforce was placed in the Temple of Light, located in the center of the Sacred Realm, which was now isolated from Hyrule. With the chaotic era at an end, the land entered an era of prosperity and Hyrule was established by the descendants of Zelda, the mortal incarnation of the goddess Hylia. This conflict took place many years after the events of Skyward Sword and before the Minish Legend.

- Minish Legend: During the early development of Kingdom of Hyrule as a kingdom, the Hero of Men fought many evil creatures during ancient times using the Picori Blade and the Light Force given to him by the Picori. He sealed the evil monsters inside of the Bound Chest using the Blade and the Light Force. The Picori Blade was enshrined by the Royal Family of Hyrule and the Light Force was sealed within Hyrule's Princess at the time. An annual Festival is held in Hyrule in response to the events of the war. It took place a hundred years before the events of The Minish Cap.

- Hyrulean Civil War: This war was begun for unknown reasons, but it was said according to the Great Deku Tree to be a horrific and prolonged war that resulted in the unification of the country under the banner of the Royal Family. At some point during the war, Link's mother was badly injured, but managed to reach the forbidden Kokiri Forest, where she entrusted her baby, the future Hero of Time, in the care of the Great Deku Tree before passing away. It took place some unknown amount of time after the events of Four Swords and a few years before the events of Ocarina of Time.

- Imprisoning War: When word of the Sacred Realm, the hidden location of the Triforce, broke out, lustful people took up war and began to enter it, evil began pouring forth from the entrance. The Knights of Hyrule were nearly wiped out during the ensuing conflict, but the Seven Sages, at the command of the King of Hyrule, were able to seal the entrance to the Sacred Realm, which had previously been transformed into the Dark World, when Ganondorf entered it and obtained the Triforce of Power from the Temple of Light. It took place many years after the Downfall Timeline ending of Ocarina of Time and hundreds of years before the events of A Link to the Past.

- Great Cataclysm: The Great Cataclysm is mentioned in a prophecy of the Seven Sages that was passed down by the people of Hyrule. The Sages predicted that Ganon would eventually try to break the Seal that they created at the conclusion of the Imprisoning War. Hundreds of years later, the prophecy came true when Ganon used an alter-ego named Agahnim to remove the King of Hyrule from his throne and rule the kingdom. Agahnim brainwashed the soldiers to gain full control over the castle and abducted maidens, descendants of the Seven Sages, teleporting them to the Dark World, so that Ganon could use their power to break the seal. This conflict occurred during the events of A Link to the Past.

- Decline Era conflict: Shortly before the events of The Legend of Zelda, Ganon invaded the kingdom with his army of demons and stole the Triforce of Power. Princess Zelda then broke the Triforce of Wisdom into 8 shards and scattered them throughout the kingdom, instructing Impa to find someone with the courage to defeat Ganon. Angered, Ganon kidnapped Princess Zelda and sent his minions after Impa, who was on the verge of being captured before she was rescued by Link. Although Link managed afterwards to defeat Ganon, six years later, his followers kept destroying the land and were scheming to resurrect their master. Link eventually restored the complete Triforce by retrieving the Triforce of Courage from the Great Palace, and brought again peace to the land. This prolonged conflict took place many years after the end of the Golden Era.

- Interloper War: When the Dark Interlopers attempted to seize control of the Sacred Realm and claim the Triforce for themselves, the Light Spirits intervened and sealed them away in the Twilight Realm, outside of which they could only exist as shadows. It took place some time before the events of Twilight Princess.

- Shadow Invasion: Hyrule was invaded by an evil Twili named Zant, who seized control of the Twilight Realm and covered Hyrule in Twilight on the order of his dark master, Ganondorf, who returned to haunt Hyrule once following his failed execution in the Arbiter's Grounds. It took place hundreds of years after the Child Timeline ending of Ocarina of Time and the events of Majora's Mask, an unknown period of time after the Interloper War, and during the events of Twilight Princess.

- Demonic Raid: In Four Swords Adventures it is mentioned that long before the events of the game, a dark tribe invaded Hyrule. The creatures of darkness were defeated and sealed away inside the Dark Mirror, which was subsequently hidden in the Temple of Darkness to sever its connection to the world.

- Dark Plague: Hyrule was in peace for hundreds of years until Ganondorf, the Gerudo Thief, was reborn. Ganondorf violated the law of the Gerudo village, when he entered the Pyramid to steal a powerful Trident located inside. After transforming into the King of Darkness, Ganon, he stole the Dark Mirror from the Temple of Darkness and covered the whole land of Hyrule in dark clouds. He created Shadow Link with the mirror, and used him to trick Link into freeing Vaati from his seal, so that Vaati could open gates to the Dark World. Ganon absorbed the Hyruleans' power and turned the Knights of Hyrule who guarded the Royal Jewels into monsters. This conflict took place hundreds of years after the events of Twilight Princess and during the events of Four Swords Adventures.

- Great Flood: Hyrule was invaded once again by Ganondorf, who broke out of his seal in the Sacred Realm, and was subsequently buried beneath a deluge of rainwater by the Golden Goddesses in an attempt to stop him dominating the kingdom when the Hero of Time failed to appear once more. The Goddesses instructed those chosen to move to the kingdom's mountaintops that would become the islands of the Great Sea. It took place many years after the Adult Timeline ending of Ocarina of Time and centuries before the events of The Wind Waker.

- Malladus War: Long before the events of Spirit Tracks, a war broke out between the Spirits of Good and the Demon King Malladus. This resulted in the Demon King being imprisoned beneath the earth by the Spirit Tracks and the Tower of Spirits. Wearied from the war, the Spirits of Good departed for the heavens and sent the Lokomos to ensure that the Demon King would not escape his seal. The war seems to have occurred many years before the arrival of the new settlers and the re-establishment of the kingdom of Hyrule by Tetra.

- Calamity Ganon: 100 years prior to the events of Breath of the Wild, an evil known as the Calamity Ganon rose up and laid waste to Hyrule. It was unable to be defeated, but was sealed within Hyrule Castle. As the years passed, the ruined Kingdom of Hyrule has become ravaged by nature over time, while the Calamity Ganon has continued to grow in power.
